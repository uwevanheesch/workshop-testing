# Test workshop Java

The code in this repository demonstrates one way of implementing
integration tests for data access objects in Java. Note that the
tests are **not complete**, although _100% coverage_ is achieved in the 
DAO. 

If you have ideas for improving or you want to contribute tests
for the classes not covered, feel free to file a **pull request**.
